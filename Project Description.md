In order to determine the optimal retail price of Tropicana 64 oz., and maximize the gross profit for the retailer, we used a two-year dataset to run three models: linear regression, log-log and semi-log model. We chose the semi-log model because of its greatest adjusted-R square value. There are 11 main variables that exist or are created: Price, Quant, Store, Week, Quarter1, Quarter2, Quarter3, Pricing Ending in 9, Holiday, BeforeHoliday, and Deal. 

The following is the functional form of the optimized semi-log model (without Holiday variable):

lq = 15.839 - 1.531price + 0.087deal + 0.0034week + 0.246qrt1 + 0.210qrt2 + 0.188qrt3 + 0.182end9 - 0.842store2 -0.609store14 - 0.326store32 - 0.440store52 - 0.546store62 - 0.636store68 - 0.681store71 - 0.556store72 - 0.546store93 - 0.909store95 - 0.613store111 - 0.480store123 - 0.667store124 - 0.628store130 + 0.186BeforeHoliday

According to this model, the optimal price we calculated is $3.22. However, based on Mantissa Pricing Strategy, especially the effect of pricing ending in 9 on consumer purchasing, we narrow the price down to $3.19 or $3.29 and ultimately recommend $3.19 as the retail price.
